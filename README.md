# wifi_attacker
HELLO dear stranger!

This script is just for coding practice(Python 2.7) !!

This script including Deauth Attack(both ap side and client side),client information sniffer(the ssid connected before,and you can
also attack the clients which are during authentication stage),Auth flood(to ap,but this seems not efficient enough,I'll update it
and the other functions in the furture)

REMEMBER if you want to use this script!!!!

1.This script only can be used on the LINUX operating system.(Highly recommend Kali Linux,that's my favorite :) )

2.This script is just for study,DON NOT ATTACKING THE OTHER PEOPLE VIA THIS SCRIPT!!!!!!

3.If your cannot run this script,maybe there are some packages missing ,plz check the packages' names from the beginning part of the script and use command "pip install...." to install the missing package

In the end,if you also keen on the cyber security(including WEB,WIRELESS),welcome to add me in the QQ or just leave a message on github XD

I am a noob of coding,but i will make an effort to take it up to the next level!
